I used to be a Beaver, and a good ol' Beaver too,
But now I've finished Beaver-ing,
I don't know what to do,
I'm growing old and feeble,
And I can Beaver no more,
So I'm going to work my ticket if I can.

Q:Chorus:
Back to Gilwell, happy land;
I'm going to work my ticket if I can.

Q:Verses:
I used to be a Bobwhite
I used to be an Eagle
I used to be a Fox
I used to be an Owl
I used to be a Bear
I used to be a Buffalo
I used to be an Antelope
I used to be a Staffer
