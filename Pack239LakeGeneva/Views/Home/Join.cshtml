  Because of the challenges of Covid for our many fundraising opportunities, our Pack committee has made the decision to implement a volunteer fee.
  This will entail a $50/first scout and $25/each additional scout per family fee.  If one adult for the family volunteers in one of the positions of need in the Pack, that fee will be returned to the Scout's account in the spring.
